    <h1>Refund and Withdrawal policy</h1>

    <p>Lambton College encourages all international students to fully explore their academic options before selecting and making any payments to Lambton College. If students have questions regarding this Refund and Withdrawal process, please contact the Lambton College International Education Office at&#160;<a href="mailto: international@lambtoncollege.ca" title="international@lambtoncollege.ca">international@lambtoncollege.ca</a>.</p>
    <p>Lambton College’s International Student Withdrawal and Refund process has been developed to be in compliance with the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities (MTCU) Fee and Refund Policy and the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) Study Permit guidelines.</p>
    <p>Lambton College bears no responsibility for funds that go astray due to inaccurate or obsolete financial information provided by the student. Applicants/students are responsible for all banking and foreign exchange charges associated with their payment/refund.</p>
    <h3>Visa Denial</h3>
    <p>Lambton College will provide a refund of any prepaid tuition (less a&#160;<strong>$250</strong>&#160;refund processing fee) if the applicant is denied a student visa under the condition that the applicant provides the Lambton College International Education Office an authentic visa denial letter issued by the Canadian High Commission within the first ten (10) days of the applicant’s first semester. Provided such visa denial letter is deemed to be genuine and accurate by the Lambton College International Education Office, the applicant will receive a refund of prepaid tuition fees, less the&#160;<strong>$250</strong>&#160;refund processing fee.</p>
    <h3>College Withdrawal</h3>
    <p>International students who withdraw within the first 10 days of the beginning of the term are entitled to a refund less an <a href="http://www.lambtoncollege.ca/Programs/International/International_Student_Administrative_Fee/" title="administrative fee">administrative fee</a>. The&#160;<a href="http://www.lambtoncollege.ca/Programs/International/International_Student_Administrative_Fee/" title="administrative fee">administrative fee</a>&#160;is calculated in accordance with the Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development's Refund Policy. If a request for withdrawal is not received within the first 10 days of the international student’s semester, no refund of semester fees will be issued.</p>
    <p>To verify the identity of the student and to safeguard prepaid monies deposited by students, all international students must request a withdrawal and refund&#160;<strong>IN PERSON</strong>&#160;at the study location indicated on the student’s letter of acceptance. &#160;&#160;A written request for withdrawal <span class="underline">will only be accepted</span>&#160;from students who have not yet entered Canada or received a valid study permit allowing entry into Canada.&#160; The written request must be sent to <a href="mailto: international@lambtoncollege.ca" title="international@lambtoncollege.ca">international@lambtoncollege.ca</a> &#160;For international students who have already entered Canada based on their acceptance to Lambton College, only withdrawal requests in person will be accepted; written requests will not be accepted.&#160;</p>
    <h4>Lambton College: All locations</h4>
    <p>As per our college's 10 day policy, students who wish to withdraw or request a refund must do so&#160;in person&#160;at the study location as indicated on the Letter of Acceptance before&#160;4:30 p.m. on&#160;Friday, May 10, 2019.&#160;&#160;The address of the study location is noted at the bottom of each letter of acceptance and can also be found below:</p>

    <h4>Lambton College – Sarnia (Main Campus)</h4>
    <p>Withdrawal requests at the incorrect location will not be accepted. &#160;&#160;Only students who request a withdrawal within the following criteria will receive an approval document from Lambton College via email:</p>
    <ul class="list-sm-arrows-blue list-unstyled">
    <li>meet the withdrawal deadline</li>
    <li>apply in person at the correct study location</li>
    <li>complete all of the refund documents provided</li>
    <li>provide a valid letter from the other institution indicating start date of studies</li>
    <li>provide original passport</li>
    <li>provide original valid permits (study and/or work permit)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If transferring to another institution, refunds will be processed only if attending an approved Designated Learning Institute for the same semester as accepted to attend at Lambton College.&#160; In order to qualify for and process the refund, a valid letter from the other institution indicating start date of studies, copy of passport and valid permits (study and/or work permit) must be presented at the time of the &#160;withdrawal application.&#160;&#160;</p>
    <p>For students accepted to educational institutions in Quebec, only students that are in possession of a Certification of Acceptance (CAQ) will be approved for a withdrawal.&#160;&#160;&#160; Failure to provide this CAQ document before the withdrawal deadline will result in the denial of the withdrawal request and no refund will be issued. The CAQ must accompany the Quebec institution’s letter of acceptance.</p>
    <p>Students who withdraw and return home must submit the withdrawal application documents including, copy of passport and valid permits (study and/or work permit), flight ticket and re-entry stamp upon return to home county.</p>
    <p>Students who defer their admission to the next intake forgo the right to receive a refund of the first semester payment if they are approved for a valid study permit to Canada. The prepayment of first semester tuition will remain with Lambton College.</p>
    <p>Students in subsequent terms (terms two, three or four) who withdraw are subject to the administrative fee charges based on the respective program of study. Students that request a transfer or withdrawal after the last day of classes of any given term are considered to be in the subsequent term for the purposes of this policy and administrative penalty.</p>
    <p>Any additional arrival expenses incurred by Lambton College on the student’s behalf, including but not limited to, temporary accommodation and airport pickup will also be required to be re-paid before a withdrawal is approved.</p>
    <p>Appropriate and warranted refunds will be processed within eight (8) weeks once Lambton College has received all documentation required to support the refund request.</p>
    <p>Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and Canada Border Services Agency will be notified of the student’s withdrawal from the College.</p>
