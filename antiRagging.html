<p>Our anti ragging policy states that : </p>

<p><b>Definition:</b> Ragging is any disorderly conduct whether by words spoken or written or by an act which has the effect of teasing, treating or handling with rudeness to any student, indulging in rowdy or undisciplined activities which cause or likely to cause annoyance, hardship or psychological harm or to raise fear or apprehension thereof in a fresher or a junior student and  which has the effect of causing or generating a sense of shame or embarrassment so as to adversely affect the psyche  of a fresher or a junior student. Supreme Court of India has defined ragging as a criminal offence.</p>

<p><b>Penalty for Ragging: </b>No person who is a student of an educational institution shall commit ragging.
